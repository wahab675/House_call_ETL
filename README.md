This project automates the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of data from Housecall Pro into Snowflake and Elasticsearch using Python.

The pipeline fetches data from the Housecall Pro API, cleans and structures it using Pandas, and then uploads it into Snowflake for analytics and Elasticsearch for fast search and visualization.

It demonstrates a full data engineering workflow, from raw API data ingestion to data warehouse and search indexing integration.
